## Project Brief
**Scenario:**
We are predicting the churn rate for a Telecoms Companny.  We are given data from 7.043 records of the Telecoms customers and our aim is to predict the churn rate for them to understand how many customers usually leave the service provider.

**Challenge:**
Use the given data set to predict the churn rate of customers for the Telecoms Company.

**Problem:**
Can we build a machine learning model that predicts what the current churn rate is?<br/><br/>

## Data

Leveraging on the [data](https://github.com/ironhack-labs/lab-imbalanced-data/blob/master/files_for_lab/customer_churn.csv) we were provided with, we used Python's data visualisation tools to explore the relationships between variables. <br/> <br/>

For further details on all features, please refer to the [notebook](https://github.com/andy1coupe/IronAndy/blob/6cc6b60f5d705b742102b8913b41c3a9f7b297e9/.ipynb_checkpoints/LabImbalancedData-checkpoint.ipynb).

## Key Take Aways 

Using Tomek and Smote we were able to get more accurate results on the burn rate, however if we had access to more data such as Age, Payment Method and perhaps Statement type we may be able to more accuratley predict the churn rate for customers.
